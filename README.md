# RESTBERTa
This repository is the official implementation of the journal article ["RESTBERTa: a Transformer-based question answering approach for semantic search in Web API documentation"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-023-04237-x) (see citation). It contains notebooks for fine-tuning pre-trained BERT models to the Web API integration tasks of parameter matching, endpoint discovery, or both, and notebooks for data preparation and evaluation.
Additional materials (datasets and reports of executed notebooks) can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10118349). The fine-tuned models (best checkpoints) are available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/SebastianKotstein).
